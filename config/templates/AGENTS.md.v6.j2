# AI Agent Instructions for BMAD Workspace

This workspace uses the BMAD (Breakthrough Methodology for AI-driven Agile Development) Method to guide the user through a software project. BMAD supports different specialized agents:
- Mary, Business Analyst
- Winston, Architect
- BMAD Master, BMAD Workflow Orientation
- Amelia, Developer
- Quinn, QA Engineer
- John, Product Manager
- Barry, Quick Flow Solo Dev
- Bob, Scrummaster
- Paige, Technical Writer
- Sally, UX Designer
If you can not find a corresponding persona activation in the context, please warn the user they are currently outside of the BMAD workflow and probably should activate an appropriate BMAD Agent (at the start of your message, unless they know what they are doing).

## Project Context

### Target Maturity Level

{% if target_maturity_level == 1 -%}
**Level 1: Concept Demo**

This project is a proof-of-concept or demo intended to validate ideas and explore feasibility. Focus on:
- Quick iterations and experimentation
- Core functionality demonstrations
- Minimal documentation (just enough to understand the concept)
- Informal code structure acceptable
- No production-readiness requirements
{% elif target_maturity_level == 2 -%}
**Level 2: Working Prototype**

This project is a functional prototype to validate technical approaches. Focus on:
- Working end-to-end functionality
- Basic error handling
- Moderate code quality and structure
- Essential documentation for handoff
- Some testing of critical paths
- Not yet production-ready but demonstrates viability
{% elif target_maturity_level == 3 -%}
**Level 3: Releasable Solution**

This project aims to be production-ready for initial release. Focus on:
- Complete feature implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Good code quality, maintainability, and structure
- Full documentation (technical and user)
- Thorough testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security considerations addressed
- Deployment readiness
{% else -%}
**Level 4: Enterprise-Ready**

This project must meet enterprise standards for production deployment. Focus on:
- Production-grade implementation
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Excellent code quality with architectural patterns
- Complete documentation suite (technical, operational, user)
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated testing
- Security hardening and compliance
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Disaster recovery and high availability
